Welcome to Escape Frogger Portal!

Excape Frogger Portal is a combination of an escape game and frogger and a
portal type game. The player tries to get to the other side of the screen,
like escape. And has to get past an enemy that goes side to side, like
frogger. After that, the player reapears on the original side of the screen,
like portal.
I was unable to make more than one enemy due to complications
with the linked list. There is no sound and no score is kept. Also, there
technicaly is no end to the game.
I had to reduce to interrupts per second to 50 in order for the game to work correctly.

Help:
Most of this project was done by myself except of course with the help of my
professon and TA. With one exception, Hiram Rios helped me understand how to
move chosen layers. I was having trouble understanding the type of program
we were assigned to create since I still had a CS3 type mentality-same as in
lab two.
